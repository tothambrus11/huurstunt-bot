Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Ambrus Tóth from Hungary, a first-year TU Delft Computer Science student. I saw your advertisement on Huurstunt.nl, and I’m interested in renting ${ad.title}.

I like maths, physics, programming, building robots, 3D designing, and printing (generally creating stuff), and I also love neoswing dancing, climbing, and photography. I don't drink alcohol, don't have any pets and I currently don't play any instruments. I also don't smoke, and I respect other residents' peace.

You can find pictures of me at https://johetajava.hu/delft-intro/

I want to rent this apartment for the next study year from August 20 until the end of June 2023, or until it is available. (I could also pay the rent for this July if necessary.)

I can send you my required documents, my guarantor’s payslip, bank statement, etc. Can we schedule a visiting for the first half of next week? My friend who is currently living in Delft could visit the apartment.

Thank you for your response and have a nice day!

Best regards,
Ambrus Tóth

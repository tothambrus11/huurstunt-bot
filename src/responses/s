Hi Easwaar,

I saw your advertisement on Facebook, and I’m interested in renting your studio.

We are Ambrus Tóth and Mihály Fey from Hungary - a prospective first-year Computer Science student and a second-year Aerospace Engineering student at TU Delft. We know each other from our high school’s robotics group.

We don't drink alcohol, don't have any pets, and we currently don't play any instruments. We also don't smoke, and we respect other residents' peace.

We want to rent this apartment for the next study year from July for at least one year, but two if possible.

I'd like to arrange a viewing in this week. Mihály is currently living in Delft, and he could visit the place, but he goes home at the end of this week, so we don't have too much time left. We could send you our required documents, our guarantor’s payslip, bank statement, etc. if needed.

Let me know if you need any more information. My introduction can be found here: https://johetajava.hu/delft-intro/

Best regards,
Ambrus Tóth

Hi Easwaar,

I saw your advertisement on Facebook, and I’m interested in renting one or possibly two rooms.

We are Ambrus Tóth and Mihály Fey from Hungary - a prospective first-year Computer Science student and a second-year Aerospace Engineering student at TU Delft. We know each other from our high school’s robotics group where we participated in various international research and robotics competitions.

I like maths, physics, programming, building robots, 3D designing and printing (generally creating stuff), and I also love neoswing dancing and climbing.

Others consider me a relatively tidy person if we speak about shared places, e.g. I like to clean up in the kitchen after cooking something, so that others won't be hindered because of me. I also consider hygiene very important. When I have time, I like cooking, especially together with others.

Let me know if you need any more information. My introduction and some pictures can be found here: https://johetajava.hu/delft-intro/

Best regards,
Ambrus Tóth

Dear Sir/Madam,

I saw your advertisement on Huurstunt.nl, and I’m interested in renting ${ad.title}.

We would like to rent this apartment with 5 students together for the next study year from August 20 until the end of June 2023, or until it is available. (We could also pay the rent for this July if necessary.)

We are Mihály Fey and Ambrus Tóth from Hungary, Jakub Grad from Poland, Domantas from Lithuania, and Vladimir Sachkov from Russia - a first-year Aerospace Engineering student, and three prospective TU Delft students.

We don't drink alcohol, don't have any pets, and we currently don't play any instruments. We also don't smoke, and we respect other residents' peace. We all love science and are dedicated to our studies.

I'd like to ask whether it would be possible to arrange a viewing in the following week. Mihály is currently living in Delft, and he could visit the place. We could send you our required documents, our guarantor’s payslip, bank statement, etc.

Thank you for your response and have a nice day!

Best regards,
Ambrus Tóth

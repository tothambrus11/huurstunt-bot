Dear Sir/Madam,

I saw your advertisement on Huurstunt.nl, and I’m interested in renting ${ad.title}.

We are Mihály Fey and Ambrus Tóth from Hungary, and Jakub Grad from Poland - a first-year Aerospace Engineering student, and two prospective Computer Science students at TU Delft.

We don't drink alcohol, don't have any pets, and we currently don't play any instruments. We also don't smoke, and we respect other residents' peace.

We want to rent this apartment with 3 students together for the next study year from August 20 until the end of June 2023, or until it is available. (We could pay the rent for this July too if necessary.)

I'd like to ask whether it would be possible to arrange a viewing in the following week. Mihály is currently living in Delft, and he could visit the place. We could send you our required documents, our guarantor’s payslip, bank statement, etc.

Thank you for your response and have a nice day!

Best regards,
Ambrus Tóth
